# PROG 01: Crunch Time

My app is a calorie converter app which takes in 4 exercises: pushups, situps, jumping jacks, and jogging. Users can input the number (labelled either reps or minutes depending on the exercise) of one of these exercises that they have done and it will not only thell them the amount of calories that they have burned, but also the equivalent of this exercise in terms of the other exercises. So for example, 175 pushups burns 50 calories and is equivalent to 100 situps, 5 minutes of jumping jacks, and 6 minutes of jogging. For example, the image below shows the layout of the app:

 

Let’s input for example 350 pushups and press the ENTER button:
			 

As you can see from above, 350 pushups are equivalent to 100 calories burned, or 200 situps, 12 minutes of jogging, or 10 jumping jacks.
Now, let’s press the RESET button:
			 

Now let’s try a different exercise. Let’s input 20 minutes of jumping jacks and press the ENTER button:

			 

As shown above 20 minutes of jumping jacks burns 200 calories, and is equivalent to 24 mins of jogging, 400 situps, and 700 pushups. Don’t forget to press RESET before inputting different values.
