# PROG 01: Crunch Time

My app is a calorie converter app which takes in 4 exercises: pushups, situps, jumping jacks, and jogging. Users can input the number (labelled either reps or minutes depending on the exercise) of one of these exercises that they have done and it will not only thell them the amount of calories that they have burned, but also the equivalent of this exercise in terms of the other exercises. So for example, 175 pushups burns 50 calories and is equivalent to 100 situps, 5 minutes of jumping jacks, and 6 minutes of jogging. More information can be found in my PDF writeup.
